<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Sejal! As a first-year university student studying web development, I’m passionate about creating seamless user experiences. I’ve dabbled in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’m eager to dive deeper into back-end technologies. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring local coffee shops or attending tech meetups. Nice to meet you!</p>
